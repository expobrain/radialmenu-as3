radialmenu-as3
==============

The project is a demo of a context menu around a circle which can be drag 
around the screen, rotated and push with a little of kinetic effect (the 
kinetic effect is not perfect but itâ€™s closer enough). 

All items can have unlimited subitems and a little tooltip. All item icons, 
labels, tooltips and hierarchy can be defined by an external XML file.
